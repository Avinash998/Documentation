## Markdown Cheet Sheet
This is intended as a quick reference and showcase about Markdown.
This cheatsheet is specifically Markdown Here's version of Github-flavored Markdown. This differs slightly in styling and syntax from what Github uses, so what you see below might vary a little from what you get in a Markdown Here email, but it should be pretty close.

You can play around with Markdown on our live demo page.

# H1

Emphasis
```
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

Lists
```
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
  * Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
  1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.  
   
   Some text that should be aligned with the above item.

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

Links
There are two ways to create links.
```
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself]

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

Code and Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and Markdown Here -- support syntax highlighting. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the highlight.js demo page.
```
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks \`\`\` , or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting.

\```javascript

var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";

alert(s);

\```

\```python

s = "Python syntax highlighting"

print s

\```

\```

No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 

But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
